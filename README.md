# 🎮 Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe AI

This project is a modern, browser-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with an unbeatable AI opponent powered by the **Minimax algorithm**.

🧠 **AI Logic:**  
The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to play perfectly, making it nearly impossible to beat.

🖥️ **Tech Stack:**
- HTML5 & CSS3 (responsive and dark-themed design)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries or frameworks)

✨ **Features:**
- Intuitive and responsive user interface
- Player vs AI mode (You play as X, AI plays as O)
- Intelligent AI that always makes the optimal move
- "New Game" button to quickly restart the match

🚀 **Getting Started:**
To try out the game, simply follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unbeatable-tictactoe-AI.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Start playing and see if you can outsmart the AI (hint: you won’t 😉).
